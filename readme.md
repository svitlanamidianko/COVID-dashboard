# Part 1 - `dashboard.py`
## How to install/config dependencies if you dont have Pandas, Numpy:
- install Python on your machine (follow doc online)
- [optional] if you wish to create virtual env, follow [these steps](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Python/virtualenv.html)
```
$cd <local copy of the repo path>
$pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # this will install all the dependencies
```
There are two modes: basic and advanced. They both are well-tested and run. Advanced allows for selecting preferences as to which info is displayed and for which date. 
#### To run script in Basic mode:
```
$python3 dashboard.py
```
#### To run script in Advanced mode:
```
$python3 dashboard.py advanced
```
(AND answer all the questions afterward)
### What would I improve in part 1 if I had more time?

- usage of better GUI as well as better UI-friendly feature like hovering on the term to see the definition.
- ability to download data as csv for further analysis in the sheets
# How to run part 2.
